# Summary:
Current webpage has main advantage, user can search upon multiple criteria at the same time.

## Drawbacks:
1. The filter method is case sensitive. Therefore if a user enterd any key in uppercase, the search result would not return.
For example; if user enter state name **CA*** in upper case insted of ***ca*** any data would not return. 
2. There is no button to click after enter the key.
3. The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a live source.

## Recommendation for further development;

1. Add the additional customization, such as click-button, or they can add dropdown list(atofiil) it can help ***guide*** the user and page more interactive.
2. Add a "Latest News" section that will highlight an article showing the most recent reported sighting.
3. This webpage showing only United State, they can add more country or global data points.
